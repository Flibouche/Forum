# Forum

The goal of this project is to develop an online forum platform that adheres to the client's specifications. The forum should enable flexible and intuitive communication among users while ensuring an optimal user experience. <br />
Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to create a proper front-end for this exercise. My trainers immediately moved me on to the Symfony framework. If you want to see my front-end skills, feel free to check out this link : <a href="https://github.com/Flibouche/SQL_Cinema">CineDune</a>

## Project Contents
- **Conceptual Data Model (CDM)**: Designing the structure of the database by modeling entities such as users, roles, messages, and topics.
- **Mockups**: Contains mockups and wireframes created using Figma for the user interface of the application.
- **Database**: Setting up a MySQL database using tools like HeidiSQL and PHPMyAdmin to store and manage the project's data.
- **SQL Queries**: Includes SQL queries for performing various tasks such as user registration, login authentication, message posting, and topic management.
- **User Interface (UI)**: Developing the user interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to enable users to interact with the forum, including viewing, adding, modifying, and deleting messages and topics.
- **Docker**: Implementing Docker to containerize the MySQL database and development environment, ensuring a portable configuration that can be easily deployed across different systems.

## Features
- **User Registration and Login**: Users can register with a pseudonym and password. Logging in is required to access the forum.
- **Role Management**: The forum supports two types of roles: standard user and administrator. Administrators have additional privileges, such as moderating messages, topics, and users, whereas standard users can manage their own messages and topics.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP for the User Interface (UI)
- Custom framework developed by the Elan Formation center in Strasbourg
- MySQL with HeidiSQL for the database
- Figma for the mockups
- Looping (Conceptual Data Modeling)
- Docker
